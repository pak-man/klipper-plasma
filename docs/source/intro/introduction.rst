Introduction
==============================

`Klipper-plasma`_ is a modified version of the 3D printing controller
`Klipper`_. It adds plasma specific G-codes and an integrated THC. It also
benefits from his parent architecture, i.e., a two part controller shared
between a PC for high level calculations and a microcontroller board to handle
real time.
